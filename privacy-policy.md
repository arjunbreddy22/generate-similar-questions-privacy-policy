Privacy Policy for "Generate Similar Questions"
Effective Date: [12/23/2024]

1. Data Collection
This extension does not collect, store, or process any user data. All interactions occur locally within your browser, and the highlighted text is processed directly on the page.

2. Use of Data
When you highlight text and click the extension button, the selected text is sent to OpenAI's API to generate similar questions and answers. This process is necessary to provide the extension's functionality. The text you select is not stored by the extension and is only used to retrieve a response from the OpenAI service.

3. Data Sharing
The selected text is shared with OpenAI's API (https://api.openai.com). This external service processes the data to generate the output. We do not share user data with any other third party.

4. Third-Party Services
This extension uses OpenAI's API to generate questions and answers. OpenAI's privacy policy applies to all data sent to their service. Please review OpenAI’s privacy policy for more details: https://openai.com/privacy.

5. Local Permissions
The extension requires access to your active tab and page content to allow you to highlight text and generate similar questions. This is strictly used for the core functionality of the extension and does not involve any data collection or storage by the extension itself.

6. Security
We take the security of user data seriously. The extension uses secure HTTPS connections to interact with OpenAI’s API to ensure data privacy during transmission.

7. Updates to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Continued use of the extension indicates your agreement to the updated policy.
